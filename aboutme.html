        <p>Hi! My name is Emily Lambrecht. I am a college sophmore with a double major in English Creative Writing and Chinese.<br> 
            I like to read, listen to music, and play video games. My favorite genre of books, tv, and video games is fantasy. <br> 
            My favorite book is Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation and I'm currently reading Heaven Official's Blessing. I don't <br>
            have a favorite video game because I am playing three at the moment. </p>

            <p>I am originally from Colorado but moved to Washington after fourth grade. My family moved to New Hampshire after I <br>
            with middle school. Most of my extended family lives in New Hampshire so I got a chance to grow closer with them. <br> 
            When I'm back home I like to get an iced chai latte from Aroma Joe's. They have the best iced chai's in New England. <br> 
            My favorite season is Autumn because I like how pretty everything looks when the leaves are changing colors.</p>
